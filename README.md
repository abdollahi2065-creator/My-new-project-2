- Optional: sample summaries for training the AI

## Outputs
- A concise summary of the educational text  
- Key sentences and important points highlighted for easy understanding

## AI Approach
- Use a Transformer-based model (e.g., BERT or T5) for text summarization  
- Apply NLP techniques to detect important sentences  
- Train the model on public educational datasets  
- Optionally fine-tune the model for different subjects

## Benefits
- Saves students’ study time  
- Improves learning efficiency  
- Can be used by schools and teachers  
- Scalable to multiple languages

## Optional Features
- Multi-language summaries  
- Simple web or mobile interface
